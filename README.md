This is my Application "VIP library" created using HTML, CSS, Js and PHP .

VIP Library greets visitors with an inviting homepage, meticulously designed to create a sense of elegance and ease of use. The focal point is the 'Add Book' button, seamlessly integrated to streamline book management.
With a click, a sophisticated form materializes, allowing users to input essential book details such as title, author, and genre. Leveraging the power of PHP, the submission process swiftly handles the data, automatically updating an XML file that serves as the backbone of the library's book catalog.

To elevate the user experience further, I employed JavaScript to implement an intelligent search feature on the 'Search Book' page. Users can effortlessly search by book title, triggering a dynamic algorithm that swiftly retrieves and displays comprehensive book information. For books not found in the library, an informative 'Book Not Found' message gracefully appears, ensuring a seamless user experience.

Building upon this solid foundation, I extended the same functionality to the 'Add Final Project' and 'Search Final Project' pages, showcasing the project's scalability and adaptability.

VIP Library epitomizes my proficiency in HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript, highlighting my ability to create engaging and sophisticated web applications. Through this project, I have honed my skills in front-end design, back-end processing, and seamless integration of multiple technologies.
